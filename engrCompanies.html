               Intel is a multinational American technology company
               known for selling some of, if not the best, microprocessors 
               in the world. Salaries for software engineers go from 
               58 to 140 thousand dollars a year.

               Hours and work environment vary, 
               although one common report is a satisfaction of working on the 
               leading edge of technology. But while some report it as a dream job, 
               stories come out of highly educated professional engineers and 
               programmers ground down by a highly antiquated corporate environment,
               crushed by 60+ hour weeks and corrupt management. Intel has locations 
               in 19 states and Washington D.C. with a lot of them residing in 
               California.

               Apple is also a multinational American technology company located 
               in California. However it sells consumer electronics and actually buys
               microprocessors from Intel to use is their devices. Apple has 478 retail 
               stores across 17 countries.

               Eerily similar to Intel, the number 1 most commonly claimed perk of 
               working at Apple was the feeling that the work done mattered and 
               significantly impacted the world. However rumors and reports 
               mention a work environment just as oppressive as Intel, but with issues
               more focued on toxicity and sexism. This probably less of a problem with 
               Intel because women make up barely more than 10% of their workers, while 
               Apple rocks a whole 32%. Hardware engineers at Apple make between 85 
               and 149 thousand a year, with some Senior software engineers making 
               over 190 thousad per year.
