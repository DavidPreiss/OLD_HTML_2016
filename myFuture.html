           On this page discuss the
         value of becoming a Professional Engineer.
         <br><br>
         You can use the information you created for
         assignment 11 and relevant information from
          Writing Assignments 2 and 3, as well as relevant
         research information you are gathering for 
         Writing Assignment 4.
         <br><br>
         
         Google Registered
         Professional Engineer and see what the requirements
          are and why you think it would be
         important to become registered. In your paper about
          the challenges we face as engineers you
         read about the ethical and professional issues faced
          by engineers over the last century. As the
         National Academy of Engineering web site states, 
         over the past century many great engineering
         achievements became so commonplace that we now take
          them mostly for granted.
          <br><br>
         
          As you wrote
         about in your Writing Assignment, engineers have a 
         significant impact on the safety and wellbeing
         of society.
         <br><br>
          In this section of your web site, 
         discuss how this impact aligns with the
         requirement that engineers must be registered.
         <br><br>
          Finally, at the end of the section include a link to
         your paper number 3 (you can post either a doc or pdf file).
          If you do not want to be an engineer
         anymore, then change the title to reflect what you want to be.
          Regardless, every profession has a
         set of ethical guidelines, so discuss them.

         To become licensed, engineers must complete a four-year college degree,
         work under a Professional Engineer for at least four years,
         pass two intensive competency exams and 
         earn a license from their state's licensure board. 
         Then, to retain their licenses, 
         PEs must continually maintain and improve their skills throughout their careers.

         Engineers are among the white collar professionals.
         As such, they are relied upon to form the backbone of
         society as a whole. In this new age of blurred lines and dubious
         qualifications, I agree that an overarching engineering certification is a good thing
         It helps give society some assurance that the people in charge of making everything
         work are actual professionals who have proven that they have what it takes. 
         Personally, I will definetly get registered. It seems that it provides such an
         atvantage, almost like a second degree.
