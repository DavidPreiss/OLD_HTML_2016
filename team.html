		Have you ever wanted some tasty ice cream, 
		but did not want to leave your house? 
		This is your lucky lifetime!
		E-Scoops is a new Company that sells ice cream, however, 
		we will graciously 
		go the extra mile and deliver it straight to your front door! 
		Never be without ice cream again! We offer a wide variety of cool 
		Flavors including vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, Mint, and more!
		E-scoops ice cream makes a wonderful gift for a cherished loved one, 
		and also can be ordered for your child's birthday. What a wonderful 
		surprise, when they receive ice cream that you don't have in the house, 
		while never leaving their house! WOW!
		</p>
		<p>
		While our physical headquarters are located in San Diego, California, 
		our main one is right here!
		We have factories and distributors all over the country and soon,
		E-scoops will be delivering to Europe and Asia.
		E-Scoops employs a staggering 700 people, and we're always looking 
		for more enthusiastic ice cream futurists.
		</p>
		</font><font color="0000FF">
		You may be wondering, how does it work? While many of our methods 
		are closely guarded trade secrets, you can be sure that we will go 
		through whatever means necessary in order to get you your ice cream.
		This means you should keep a lookout, if you are given your order by
		a man in an unmarked white van, don't be shy, take what's yours and 
		enjoy a frosty treat! You might also find your order in your mailbox,
		in a box on your doorstep, or even conveniently placed in your 
		refrigerator, so keep your eyes peeled!
