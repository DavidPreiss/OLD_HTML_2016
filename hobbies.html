         Why I love college
      </h2>
      <p align=center>
         <!--<font color="FF22FF" size="5" face="Comic sans MS">-->
         1 - Control - In general, I love the control over my own life I now have. 
         No one telling me where I need to be and when I need to be there. 
         No one is telling me to take the trash out or do the laundry or come 
         down for dinner or get off the computer and do my homework. These are 
         all decisions I make myself and, despite how petty it sounds, that makes
         all the difference.
         <br>
         2 - Food - I love the food here. I know that may seem weird but I’m pretty
         particular when it comes to how I like my eggs and broccoli. Pitt does 
         both just right. Market has a delicious spectrum to choose from and is open at
         most hours. I love getting a chicken stir fry after a hard workout. Or grabbing
         an omelette in the morning is just amazing. There are also plenty of little 
         independent shops and dives to explore and try in between my dorm and the rest of campus.
         <br>
         3 - Dorm - Living in the freshman engineer dorm is great. Everyone has 
         mostly the same classes so if you want or need assistance with something,
         it's super easy to find someone to help. It also makes it really easy to 
         make friends since you’ll keep seeing the same people in both your classes
         and your dorm. It can really work wonders in masking the enormity of the student 
         body which might otherwise feel a bit overwhelming.
         <br>
         4 - Schedule  - Being able to pick my own schedule is so great.
         I can decide to maintain my routine from high school, or mix it up as an experiment.
         I can choose to make certain days lighter, or to give myself breaks 
         between each class. It’s also nice because, beyond the customizability, 
         there is generally less time spent in class, leaving more for whatever I want to do.
         <br>
         5 - Responsibility  - Another strangely pleasant thing is the responsibility placed on
         students. If you decide that you don’t need to attend a lecture, no one freaks out.
         It’s all your choice. If you do all of the work a week ahead, no one cares. You can do
         the practice problems, or you can choose not to. The responsibility for our own success 
         is something that I think most of us have desired for a long time.
         <br>
         6 - New - I love that this is all new. A fresh start.
         I was sick of my life back home. I was tired of my friends and family.
         I was annoyed by the patterns I’d been staring at my entire life.
         This change is great is part simply because it is a change. It feels like progress.

         Things I have learned about college

         I thought that taking care of myself in terms of food, hygiene,
         and clothing would be easy and I was right.
         <br>
         I thought that my classes would all be easy and I was wrong.
         <br>
         I've discovered that none of my classes are in the Cathedral of Learning.
