			<dt>Where we come from</dt>
				<dd>
				E-Scoops started as an idea. One hot summer day, in 2002, 
				a young man wished he could just order some ice cream online, 
				and that it would be delivered to his house with a smile. 
				That man was Dalton Jones, founder and CEO of E-Scoops. 
				He soon realized his dream and created the largest internet-
				based ice cream distribution network in the world.
				</dd>
			<dt>Where we are</dt>
				<dd>
				We here at E-scoops work tirelessly to inovate the 
				processes involved with both creating our ice cream, 
				as well as shipping it to your front door. 
				We have factories all over the United States and are 
				looking to construct more to expand our range and shorten 
				delivery times.
				</dd>
			<dt>Where we're going<dt>
				<dd>
				We are polling customers to learn what currently existing
				flavors to add to our menu, but we are also	researching 
				and exciting flavors that no one has ever tasted! 
				A constant influx of new employees means that delivery 
				times are quick and getting quicker. 
				New drone technology and Smart phone location tracking
				may even allow us to deliver your ice cream directly to you, 
				whereever you may be! Truly E-Scoops is the ice cream company 
				of the future.
