          Follow this with a
         Definition list that lists 2 current job/position 
         descriptions in your field/area of engineering.
         Below each definition term, add a 2 - 3 paragraph
          definition data about these positions. Make the
         color, size and type of font for this text in each
          definition data something different that the rest of
         the web page. Use your Writing Assignments for your information.

                  Software engineers generally are the ones who write the programs used in 
                  electronic computing systems using code. Creativity is important for being
                  able to find the solutions to complex problems. Brevity and efficiency of code 
                  is also vital to reduce load times and avoid crashes. Diligence and dicipline 
                  are also important so that another programmer can understand and make easy 
                  edits to your code.

                  Days are usually spent analyzing the needs of clients and then designing 
                  a system to meet those needs. They might also recommend software upgrades 
                  to existing systems.

                  Hardware engineers design the actual machine on which all the relevent 
                  programs will run. They create blueprints and prototypes of planned products.

               <p>
                  Hardware engineers also make sure that new systems can run the most advanced 
                  programs with minimal impact to performance. All while making sure that older 
                  programs that were designed for older systems can still run just fine.
