            My name is David Preiss. I was born in Arlington Hospital on Thanksgiving of 1997.
            My parents are Robert and Valerie Preiss. I have no brothers or sisters and am an only child.

            I attended Arlington Science Focus School from 2003 - 2009. 
            I lived very close so I walked to school. I attended Swanson Middle School from 2009 - 2012.
            I lived pretty far from Swanson so I had to take the bus. I attended 
            Washington-Lee High School 2012-2016. Washington-Lee was in between Swanson and
            ASFS so I walked, but it was a bit of a hike. I am now enrolled in the Swanson School 
            of Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. I plan on majoring in Computer Engineering
            and then becoming a computer engineer.

            My favorite food is gumbo. There was once a time 
            when I thought that the idea of a favorite food was silly. How can you have a favorite?
            It all depends on your mood right? One day you might crave a juicy steak, the other,
            a hot pumpkin pie. This was all before I had gumbo.

            My favorite movie is Flatland. 
            The kiddy one not the wierd one. This is simply because by being about 2-dimensional beings
            trying to comprehend the 3rd dimension, it creates a fantastic platform for understanding the
            4th dimension from the perspective of 3-dimensional beings. It is also presented
            in such a way that even a child could understand it.

            I really enjoy 
            flipping balisong knives, otherwise known as butterfly knives. After getting my hands on one,
            I quickly started carrying it everywhere, compulsively doing the tricks that I 
            was rapidly teaching myself. As you can imagine, this was a bit of a problem for a 
            child attending high school. I stopped because it was also becoming legitimately addicting.
            To this day I sometimes consider getting back into it, only to decide not to out of the fear 
            that I'd never get out.
