               Follow this with a 2 - 3 paragraph
               introduction. Make the color, size and 
               type of font for this text something different that the rest
               of the web page. Within this introduction,
                include a numbered list that identifies an overview of
               careers in engineering. The list should include at least 6 items
                and should list the items with
               Capital letters starting with the letter D.

            Engineers use math and science to solve practical problems.
            While most other white collar proffessions, and indeed, most
            jobs in general, deal only with maintaining society, 
            engineers work to improve it. In general, Engineers bring
            the abstract ideas of others into the real world.

            In construction, the 
            architect may create the plans for the building, but it must then
            be approved by an engineer to ensure that it is actually possible to build
            within the given constraints. Since engineering is required in order
            to realize most worthwhile pursuits, there are many different fields of 
            specialization. Here is a short list of just a few of the careers within
            engineering.

               Follow this with 2 - 3 paragraphs about the career in this area.
               Somewhere in this description of your area of interest add another
                ordered list that lists at least 5
               items that gives an overview of careers in your specific area of interest.
                This list should use lower case roman numerals and begin with "i". 
               Make the color, size and type of font for this text
               the default of the web page. For this part of the Web Page, 
               use any relevant information you have from Writing Assignments 2 and 3,

            Computer engineers research, design, develop, and test 
            computer systems and components such as processors, circuit boards, 
            memory devices, networks, and routers. Circuitry architecture is very 
            important.
